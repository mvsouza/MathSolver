# Math solver

Just a brief description of this assesment.
We are eager to know you better, we hope to find out what are you capable of.
Depending on your first interview we will ask you to do some specific Stories.
We've covered all stories on the issues, including those you need to solve, so be sure to solve all we asked you presviously.
We avaliate you in the following topics:

- Object Oriented Design (class, abstract, Interface, override, access permissions, inheritance, polymorphism); 
- C# and dotnet features (extension method, reflection, dynamic, lambda, delegate, Linq, C# 7, Exception Handling, generic, Variance/Covariance, Task, await, async);
- Agile patterns, principles and practices in Agile (Craftsmanship);
