  - Agile patterns, principles and practices in Agile (Craftsmanship);
  - Solution architecture and derivablity; 
  - Testability and quality strategies;
  - Documentation capability: it should be easy to understand your desing/architecture choises and how it should function;
  - We like web applications, cosider doing one, UX isn't a issue here;
  - Write this application as you would deliver to production, not as a demo;
  

## User Storie

***As*** a student<br> 
***I want to*** post a fatorial calculus with add and mutiple operations<br>
***In order to*** validate its result

- The fatorial calculus should accept add and mutiple operation;
- Mutiplication should precede addition;
- Be able to reinforce precedence by using parentheses;
- All open parentheses should have other to close;
